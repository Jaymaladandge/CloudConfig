The URL you've mentioned, http://admsjava-jaymala.ctpl.in:9094/application/default, is likely a request made to a Spring Cloud Config Server instance. Let's break down the URL:

http://: 	This specifies the protocol used for the request, in this case, HTTP.

admsjava-jaymala.ctpl.in: 	This is the hostname of the server where the Spring Cloud Config Server is hosted.
 It's possible that "admsjava-jaymala.ctpl.in" is the domain name or hostname of your server.
 
9094: 	This is the port number on which the Spring Cloud Config Server is running. 
In this case, it's running on port 9094.

/application/default: 	This is the endpoint on the Config Server that is being accessed. In a Spring Cloud Config Server, 
the /application part is usually a placeholder for the application name, and default refers to the default profile. 
This endpoint typically returns the configuration properties for the specified application (application) and profile (default).

So, when you hit http://admsjava-jaymala.ctpl.in:9094/application/default, 
you are requesting the configuration properties for the application named application and the default profile.
 These properties are typically stored in a Git repository or some other backend, and 
 the Config Server retrieves them and serves them to clients (such as your Spring Boot application) upon request.
